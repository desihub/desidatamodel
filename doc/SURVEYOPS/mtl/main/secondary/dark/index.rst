The ``dark`` directory hosts MTL ledgers for the DESI dark-time program.
Targets are stored in ledgers that are split by HEALPixel (in the NESTED
scheme) at a resolution of nside=32.

The filename for each ledger resembles mtl-dark-hp-HPX.ecsv, where HPX
is the healpixel number.

Subdirectories and files:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   mtl-dark-hp-HPX.rst : MTL ledgers for the DESI dark-time program (secondary targets).
