:envvar:`altmtl` contains the merged target list (mtl) decisions with subpriorities re-seeded, but following the fiber-specific observational information on whether the target assigned to a particular positioner was successful. These are split into the bright and dark time observations, and these are the possibilities for `PROGRAM`.
