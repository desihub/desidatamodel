:envvar:`altmtl` contains the merged target list (mtl) decisions (see :doc:`link to real data </SURVEYOPS/mtl/sv3/index.rst>`)with subpriorities re-seeded, but following the fiber-specific observational information on whether the target assigned to a particular positioner was successful. There are 128 realizations, each in a separate Univ{UNUM} directory, each of which is split into dark and bright programs.
