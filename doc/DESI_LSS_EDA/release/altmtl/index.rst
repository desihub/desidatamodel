:envvar:`altmtl` contains the merged target list (mtl) decisions ( :doc:`see <../../../SURVEYOPS/mtl/sv3/dark/sv3mtl-dark-hp-HPX>`) with subpriorities re-seeded, but following the fiber-specific observational information on whether the target assigned to a particular positioner was successful. There are 128 realizations, each in a separate Univ{UNUM} directory, each of which is split into dark and bright programs.
