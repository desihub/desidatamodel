=======

:envvar:`release` contains directories for the end-products LSS catalogs (`LSScats`), inputs based on processing of the spectroscopic reductions (`inputs_wspec`), and from processing of fiberassign information (`potential_assignments`). Products come from the root :envvar:`DESI_LSS_EDA`. 
The name reflects the name of the release, like `sv3` or `da02`.
