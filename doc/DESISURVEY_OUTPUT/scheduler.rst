Data: FITS image [float64, 16071]

The data is a 1D array of the integrated squared signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
accumulated on each tile so far, relative to the target value.
Tile indexing matches
`desisurvey.tiles.Tiles <https://desisurvey.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#desisurvey.tiles.Tiles>`__.

Notes and Examples
==================

A `Scheduler object <https://desisurvey.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#desisurvey.scheduler.Scheduler>`__
schedules observations during each night::

    import desisurvey.scheduler
    scheduler = desisurvey.scheduler.Scheduler()

Its internal state after each afternoon can be saved using, for example::

    scheduler.save('scheduler_snapshot.fits')

This state can then be later restored using::

    scheduler = desisurvey.scheduler.Scheduler(restore='scheduler_snapshot.fits')
