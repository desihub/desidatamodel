:Summary: Record of simulated exposures.
:Naming Convention: ``exposures_surveysim.fits``
:Regex: ``exposures_surveysim\.fits``
:File Type: FITS, 2 MB  (scales with the number of exposures)

*Note*: currently this is only an output from surveysim, but it may become an
output of survey operations, caching in a file the information that is also
contained in the operations database.

There is one table row per tile, indexed to match `desisurvey.tiles.Tiles
<https://desisurvey.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#desisurvey.tiles.Tiles>`__.

The integer ``AVAIL`` and ``PLANNED`` values are nights since the date specified
by the ``NIGHT`` keyword in HDU0.

A tile is considered "available" once it has fibers assigned. A tile is considered
"planned" once its priority has been set non-zero. In general, these changes of
state occur independently: availability is determined by the fiber assignment
policy and when covering tiles have been completed, while the priorities are
set by `survey strategy rules
<https://desisurvey.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#module-desisurvey.rules>`__.
**A tile will not be scheduled until it is both available and planned.**

Notes and Examples
==================

An `ExposuresList
<https://surveysim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#surveysim.exposures.ExposureList>`__
object records exposures during simulation::

    import surveysim.exposures
    explist = surveysim.exposures.ExposureList()

Its internal state after a simulation (or each night) can be saved using, for example::

    explist.save('exposures.fits', comment='Baseline (seed=1)')

This state can then later be restored using::

    explist = surveysim.exposures.ExposureList(restore='exposures.fits')
