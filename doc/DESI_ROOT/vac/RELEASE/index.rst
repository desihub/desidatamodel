``${DESI_ROOT}/vac/RELEASE`` contains the Value Added Catalogs (VAC) associated with a
particular data release. The value of ``RELEASE`` will typically be ``edr``, ``dr1``, and so on.

Within this directory, each VAC will have a unique name.

Only some VACs include data model descriptions here;
see https://data.desi.lbl.gov/doc/releases/edr/#value-added-catalogs
