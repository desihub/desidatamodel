``$DESI_ROOT/vac/RELEASE/lss/SPECPROD`` defines the spectroscopic production run. For EDR, we use ``fuji``, named after the mountain and signifying the sixth internal release of data. More information can be found in `EDR. DESI Collaboration (in prep.)`_.  

Here ``SURVEY`` defines the LSS-defined selection of tiles. For the EDR, it represents the One-Percent Survey named as ``sv3``.
