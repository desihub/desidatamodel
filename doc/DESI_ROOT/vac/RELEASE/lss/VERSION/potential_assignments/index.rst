potential_assignments
=====================

In EDR ``$DESI_ROOT/vac/edr/lss/v2.0/potential_assignments`` contains directories for the potential assigment outputs from fiber assigment, reading from :ref:`$DESI_TARGET/fiberassign<fiberassign>` and concatenated into single files, for data and randoms separately. In the case of randoms, it also contains the complete fiber assigment files run with the same configuration as with the data.
