Each of the ``dark`` directories associated with each ``{UNUM}`` hosts an alternative MTL ledger for the DESI dark-time program, with a data format matching that used for actual observations.
These ledgers are split by HEALPixel (in the NESTED
scheme) at a resolution of nside=32.

The filename for each ledger resembles sv3mtl-dark-hp-HPX.ecsv, where HPX
is the healpixel number.
