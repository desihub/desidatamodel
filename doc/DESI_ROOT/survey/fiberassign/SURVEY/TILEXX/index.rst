TILEXX

``TILEXX`` is the first three characters of the zero-padded 6-digit TILEID.

The descriptions of the files here reflect the ``main`` survey. The intermediate *files*
for ``SV1``, ``SV2``, ``SV3``, ``special`` are simlar to ``main``, but the directory
structures were somewhat different and reflect an evolving situation.
