SURVEY
======

The ``SURVEY`` is the phase of the overall DESI project the spectra were
observed in.  For example, ``SV1``, ``SV2``, ``SV3``, ``main``, following
the naming convention used in this set of files.

The descriptions here and below reflect the ``main`` survey. The intermediate *files*
for ``SV1``, ``SV2``, ``SV3``, ``special`` are simlar to ``main``, but the directory
structures were somewhat different and reflect an evolving situation.
