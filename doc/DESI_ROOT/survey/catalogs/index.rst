``${DESI_ROOT}/survey/catalogs`` contains the main DESI LSS catalogs, used to measure the BAO and constrain cosmology. These are associated 
with a specific ``RELEASE`` such as Data Release 1 (DR1) and any sequentially numbered releases (the EDR LSS catalogs are within ``${DESI_ROOT}/vac`` and have a different organizational structure).
