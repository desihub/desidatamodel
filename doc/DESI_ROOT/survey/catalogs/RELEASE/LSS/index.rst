``${DESI_ROOT}/survey/catalogs/RELEASE/LSS`` host the LSS catalogs tagged by the spectroscopic production used (SPECPROD), named after mountains, e.g. “iron” for DR1. Normally, we will publish just one SPECPROD per data release.

In addition, we include initial 18 random files with all potential assigments (randomRANN) and products used to calculate the PIP weights with the AltMTL method (altmtl, put REF).
