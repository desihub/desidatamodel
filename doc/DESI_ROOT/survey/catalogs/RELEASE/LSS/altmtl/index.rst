``${DESI_ROOT}/survey/catalogs/{RELEASE}/LSS/altmtl`` contains the Merged Target List (MTL) ledgers ( :ref:`see MTL documentation <mtl_ledger>`) with subpriorities re-seeded, but following the fiber-specific observational information on whether the target assigned to a particular positioner was successful. For each OBSCON ``DARK`` and ``BRIGHT``, there are 128 realizations, each in a separate ``Univ{UNUM}`` directory.
