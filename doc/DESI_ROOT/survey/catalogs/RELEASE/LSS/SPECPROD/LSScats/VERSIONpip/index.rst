VERSIONpip
==========

VERSIONpip contains same catalogs as VERSION, completeness weights that are built from the record of alternative fiber assignment histories. These assignment histories also allow pairwise-inverse-probability (PIP) weights to be calculated for 2-point clustering measurements. Healpix maps are the same and are found in the same VERSION directory
