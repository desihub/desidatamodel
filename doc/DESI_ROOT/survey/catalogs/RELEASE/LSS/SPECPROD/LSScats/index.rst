``${DESI_ROOT}/survey/catalogs/{RELEASE}/LSS/{SPECPROD}/LSScats`` separate different versions of the final clustering catalogs, depending on progressive improvements of the reduction pipeline. Several versions can be found for the same RELEASE. In DR1, the catalogs that include a record of alternative fiber assignment histories and completeness weights that are built from them, are available in directories with the ``pip`` suffix.

In order to know which version you need to use, please check `DESI publications`_.
