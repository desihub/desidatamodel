``${DESI_ROOT}/survey/catalogs/RELEASE/LSS/SPECPROD/LSScats`` separate different versions of the final clustering catalogs, depending on progressive improvements of the reduction pipeline. Several versions can be found for the same RELEASE. Also, we can also found alternative completeness weights using PIP weights, substituing the standard completeness weights, in different directories with the ``pip`` suffix.

In order to know which version you need to use, please check DESI publications.
