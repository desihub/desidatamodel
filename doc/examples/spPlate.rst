:Summary: Combined spectra for one plate.
    The spPlate files contain the combined spectra for all exposures of
    a given plate.  There are typically four 900s exposures which may
    have been taken in a single night, or over multiple nights.  This page
    is an updated summary of the `SDSS2 spPlate data model`_ .
:Naming Convention: ``spPlate-PLATE4-MJD5.fits``, where ``PLATE4`` is the
    zero-padded, four-digit plate number and ``MJD5`` is the five-digit MJD.
:Regex: ``spPlate-[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{5}\.fits``

Notes and Examples
==================

Additional HDUs may be present for engineering purposes,
but are not supported and are subject to change.
Users should refrain from using HDUs not listed here.

There are two masks, an "AND" mask and an "OR" mask.
The spectra are constructed from 3 or more 15-minute observations,
and the "AND" mask bits are set if that bit is set for each and
every input observation. The "OR" mask bits are set if that bit
is set for any of the observations.
Usually, only "AND" mask is of interest.

The mask bits are set as follows.
The authoritative definition of mask bits is in
`idlutils/data/sdss/sdssMaskbits.par`_, with an alternate parsing at the
`data release documentation`_.  They are included here for convenience:

.. _`idlutils/data/sdss/sdssMaskbits.par`: http://www.sdss3.org/svn/repo/idlutils/trunk/data/sdss/sdssMaskbits.par

.. |chi2| replace:: :math:`\chi^2`

When low numbered bits (<16) are set,
those will be set for half of the spectra:
either the blue or red spectrograph.
The higher-numbered bits (>=16) are set for individual pixels.

Which mask bits are important?
The conditions that are considered very bad are already
used to set the errors to infinity for the effected pixels
(specifically, the inverse variance is set to zero).
The most useful mask bit to look at is BRIGHTSKY,
which indicates when the sky is so bright relative to the
object that perhaps one shouldn't trust any of the object flux there.
Our reported errors are meant to include sky-subtraction errors,
but there are instances (particularly around 5577) where these
errors may be untrustworthy.

Dispersion and sky: The dispersion per pixel and the sky flux
are computed at each pixel by re-weighting the individual spectra
at each pixel according to their formal errors.
This re-weighting is only approximate.

Sky wavelengths: Note that the sky lines are slightly shifted
in the reductions because we transform the velocities to the
barycenter of the solar system.
Each exposure that contributes to the co-added spectra will have
slightly different barycenter correction, so the "average sky"
contains a superposition of these slightly-offset sky lines.
These shifts keep the object spectra as-measured at the barycenter,
regardless of the time of year or the Earth's rotation relative
to the spectroscopic targets.
