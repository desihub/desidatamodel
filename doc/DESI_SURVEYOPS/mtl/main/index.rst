``main`` is the root directory for the Merged Target List ledgers for the
DESI Main Survey. The MTL ledgers record the state of each DESI target as
redshift information is acquired. There is a set of ledgers for each of the
DESI Main Survey primary programs (``dark``, ``bright`` and ``backup``) as
well as for the DESI secondary programs (``secondary``) and for Targets
of Opportunity (``ToO``).

Subdirectories:

   secondary/index
   ToO/index
