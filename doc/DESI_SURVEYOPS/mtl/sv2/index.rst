``sv2`` is the root directory for the Merged Target List ledgers for the
second phase of Survey Validation. The MTL ledgers record the state of each
DESI target as redshift information is acquired. There is a set of ledgers
for each of the DESI SV2 primary programs (``dark``, ``bright`` and ``backup``).

Subdirectories:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   dark/index
   bright/index
   backup/index
