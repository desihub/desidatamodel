The ``bespoke`` directory includes secondary programs that needed special
handling to be incorporated into DESI observations. The ``bespoke`` directory
contains simple text files with an accompanying README file that describes each
special program.

Individual "bespoke" files are not documented further in the data model --- consult
the README file for each program for additional details.
