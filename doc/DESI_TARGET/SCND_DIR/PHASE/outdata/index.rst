The ``outdata`` directory contains files from the ``indata`` directory
with the added targeting information (`i.e.` IDs and bits) needed by
the DESI pipeline.

Under each Data Release, data are grouped according to the release
number (tag) of the desitarget code version on GitHub that was used to
process the secondary targets.
