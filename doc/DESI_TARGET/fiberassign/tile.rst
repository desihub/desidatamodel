General Description
===================

FITS file with fiber assignments for a given DESI tile.

Naming Convention
-----------------

TBD.  We should group under subdirectories of
$DESI_TARGET/fiberassign/, but the naming for the subdirectories and for the
files themselves is TBD.

regex: ``tile-[0-9]{8}\.fits``

numtarget     int32            number of targets that this fiber covers
t_priority    int32            target priority [deprecated?]
BRICKNAME     char[8]          Brick name from tractor input
============= ======= ======== ===================

Notes:

  * we will probably change these to UPPERCASE and adjust some names (e.g. t_priority to PRIORITY)
  * x/yfocal_design are where fiber assignment thought the targets would
    be; this is non-authoritative and more detailed downstream code may have a
    refined answer

HDU2
----

Potential assignments.

A list of targets that could have been assigned to each fiber.
See DESI-1049 (https://desi.lbl.gov/DocDB/cgi-bin/private/ShowDocument?docid=1049) for
how to interpret this HDU.
