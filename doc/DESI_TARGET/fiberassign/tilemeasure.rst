General Description
===================

FITS file with fiber assignments for a given DESI tile.

Naming Convention
-----------------

TBD.  We should group under subdirectories of
$DESI_TARGET/fiberassign/, but the naming for the subdirectories and for the
files themselves is TBD.

regex: ``tilemeasure-[0-9]{8}-[xx]\.fits``
