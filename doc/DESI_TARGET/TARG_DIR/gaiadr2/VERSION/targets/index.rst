The ``targets`` directory holds catalogs of DESI targets derived from
Gaia. Under the ``targets`` directory data are grouped according to the
specific DESI observational phase. Observational phases include "mainX"
for iterations of the DESI Main Science Survey, "svX" for iterations
of Survey Validation and "cmx" for commissioning, where "X" is an integer.
