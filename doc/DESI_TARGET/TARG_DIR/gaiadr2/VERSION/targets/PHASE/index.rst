PHASE
=====

``PHASE`` is a specific DESI observational phase, which can include
"mainX" for iterations of the DESI Main Science Survey, "svX" for
iterations of Survey Validation and "cmx" for commissioning, where X
is an integer. Under each target phase, data are grouped according to
whether the targets have been resolved to account for duplicates in
overlapping Legacy Surveys imaging. The northern and southern imaging
footprints overlap and are *resolved* to only retain targets in the northern
imaging that are both at Dec. > 32.375 degrees and north of the Galactic Plane.
