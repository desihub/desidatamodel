BACKUP
======

``BACKUP`` refers to either a directory called ``supp``
prior to version ``0.50.0`` of the ``desitarget`` code or ``backup`` for
``0.50.0``, or later, of the ``desitarget`` code. The choice of ``backup``
versus ``supp`` is semantic, and files in the ``BACKUP`` directory are
similarly constructed.
