targets
=======

:Summary: DESI target selection files contain a single binary table covering the
    entire footprint.  They contain the variables used by target selection
    (*e.g.* fluxes), variables needed by fiber assignment (*e.g.* RA, DEC),
    and variables needed for traceability (*e.g.* TARGETFLAG, TARGETID).
:Naming Convention: ``DRX/VERSION/targets-DRX-VERSION.fits``, where ``DRX`` is the
    imaging surveys data release name (e.g. dr7.1) and ``VERSION`` is the
    desitarget code version defining the cuts (e.g. 0.22.0).
:Regex: ``targets-dr[0.9]+\.[0-9]+-v?[0-9]+\.[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+|)\.fits``
:File Type: FITS, 30 GB


**Note**: this documents the target catalog format starting with DR7 /
desitarget 0.22.0 .  The previous format is documented in :doc:`targets-dr6`.

Notes and Examples
==================

In general, the above format contains:

* Columns that were used by target selection (e.g. FLUX_G/R/Z)
* Columns needed by fiber assignment (e.g. RA, DEC)
* Columns needed for traceability (e.g. BRICKNAME, TARGETID, DESI_TARGET, BGS_TARGET, MWS_TARGET)

FRACFLUX and FRACMASKED are profile-weighted quantities

SUBPRIORITY, PHOTSYS, TARGETID, DESI_TARGET, BGS_TARGET, MWS_TARGET and HPXPIXEL are created by target selection; the rest are passed through from the original input tractor or sweep files

See http://legacysurvey.org for more details about the columns from input tractor files
