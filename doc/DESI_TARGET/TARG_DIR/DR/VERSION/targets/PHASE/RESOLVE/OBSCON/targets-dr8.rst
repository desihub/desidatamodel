targets
=======

:Summary: DESI target selection files include a single binary table containing
    the targets in a (nested) HEALPixel. They contain the variables used by
    target selection (*e.g.* fluxes), variables needed by fiber assignment (*e.g.*
    RA, DEC), and variables needed for traceability (*e.g.* DESITARGET, TARGETID).
:Naming Convention: ``PHASEtargets-OBSCON-RESOLVE-hp-HP.fits``,
    where ``PHASE`` is a specific DESI observational phase (*e.g.* svX with X=1,2
    for iterations of Survey Validation), ``OBSCON`` is the observing condition
    (or "layer") for the targets (*e.g.* dark), ``RESOLVE`` is "noresolve" for
    targets that are not resolved, and ``HP`` is the HEALPixel covered by the file
    at the (nested) HEALPixel nside included in the file header as ``FILENSID``
    (*e.g.* 11). For targets that are *not* resolved ``RESOLVE`` is omitted from
    the filename. For targets that are part of the DESI Main Science Survey
    ``PHASE`` is omitted from the filename.
:Regex: ``.*?targets-.*?-hp-?[0-9]+\.fits``
:File Type: FITS, 2 GB

**Note**: this documents the target catalog format starting with DR8 /
desitarget 0.31.0 .  The previous format is documented in :doc:`targets-dr7`.

Notes
=====

In general, the above format contains:

* Columns that were used by target selection (e.g. FLUX_G/R/Z).
* Columns needed by fiber assignment (e.g. RA, DEC).
* Columns needed for traceability (e.g. BRICKNAME, TARGETID, DESI_TARGET, BGS_TARGET, MWS_TARGET).

FRACFLUX and FRACMASKED are profile-weighted quantities.

SUBPRIORITY, OBSCONDITIONS, PRIORITY_INIT, NUMOBS_INIT, PHOTSYS, TARGETID,
DESI_TARGET, BGS_TARGET, MWS_TARGET and HPXPIXEL are created by target selection;
the rest are passed through from the original `LS`_ tractor or sweep files.

See https://www.legacysurvey.org for more details about columns in the data model.
