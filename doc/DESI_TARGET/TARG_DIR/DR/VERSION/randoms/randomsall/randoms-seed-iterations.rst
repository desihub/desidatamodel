randomsall
==========

:Summary: The larger DESI random catalogs (``randomsall``) contain a single binary
	  table covering the entire Legacy Surveys footprint. They contain meta
	  information (the number of observations, the depth, etc.) derived from
	  pixels in Legacy Surveys CCDs at random RA/Dec coordinates. The content of
	  these files resembles the standard, smaller DESI random catalogs.
:Naming Convention: ``randomsall-seed-iterations.fits``, where ``seed`` represents
	the random seed used to generate the catalog and ``iterations`` lists the iteration
	numbers of the smaller random catalogs that have been concatenated to make
	the larger random catalog.
:Regex: ``randoms-[0-9]+-[0-9]+\.fits``
:File Type: FITS, 63 GB
