PHASE
=====

``PHASE`` is a specific DESI observational phase, which can include
"mainX" for iterations of the DESI Main Science Survey, "svX" for
iterations of Survey Validation and "cmx" for commissioning, where X
is an integer. Under each phase, data are grouped according to
whether a catalog has been resolved to account for duplicates in
overlapping Legacy Surveys imaging. The northern and southern imaging
footprints overlap and are *resolved* to only retain targets in the northern
imaging that are both at Dec. > 32.375 degrees and north of the Galactic Plane.
